# OpenCV_Projs

Simple Projects developed using the OpenCV Library

## 1. Face detector
 
  -- I have developed a program which detects the users face by using their system's Internal webcam.
  -- We shall create a bounding box around the detected face using the Open CV.
  -- This program uses the well known Viola-Jones Algorithm basically used for face recognition problem.
  -- You can also find the related xml file i.e. a cascade file used to detect the frontal face.

## 2. Face and Eye detector

  -- I have developed a program which detects the users face by using their system's Internal webcam.
  -- We create a rectangle around the detected face using the OpenCV tools.
  -- This program uses the well known Viola-Jones Algorithm for face detection.
  -- You can also find the related xml file in the directory
