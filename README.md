# OpenCV_Projs

Simple Projects developed using the OpenCV Library

## 1. Face detector

 
  -- I have developed a program which detects the user's face by using their system's Internal webcam.
  
  
  -- In this code we shall create a bounding box around the detected face using Open CV.
  
  
  -- This program uses the well known Viola-Jones Algorithm basically used for face recognition problem.
  
  
  -- You can also find the related xml file i.e. a cascade file used to detect the frontal face.


## 2. Face and Eye detector


  -- Here I have developed a program which detects the user's face aswell as their eyes by using their system's Internal webcam.
  
  
  -- Here we shall create a rectangle around the detected face and make it as our region of interest to detect the eyes instead of looking all over the image, using the OpenCV tools.
  
  
  -- This program uses the well known Viola-Jones Algorithm which is basically used for face recognition.
  
  
  -- Viola-Jones algorithm makes use of Haar-like features to detect a face. 
  
  
  -- You can also find the related xml files in the directory.
  
  
## 3. Smile Detector

  -- Here I have developed a program which detects the user's smile by using the reference of their face.
  
  
  -- Initially we try to detect the face using our face_detector program.
  
  -- Once the face gets detected, we shall take face ase our region of interest to reduce the conputational power and detect the moth of the user.
  
 -- When the user smiles, depending upon their lips movement a smile is detected using Haarlike features.
 
 -- All the required xml files for the cascade detector has been uploaded in the working folder.
