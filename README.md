Simple Projects developed using the OpenCV Library
1. Face detector
  -- I have developed a program which detects the users face by using their system's Internal webcam.
  -- We shall create a rectangle around the detected face using the OpenCV tools.
  -- This program uses the well known Viola-Jones Algorithm for face detection.
  -- You can also find the related xml file in the directory
